This project uses machine learning to segment customers for market analysis. By analyzing demographics, purchase history, and behavior patterns, we identify customer groups to help businesses create targeted marketing campaigns and personalize interactions, boosting satisfaction, loyalty, and revenue.

Data includes age, gender, income, transactions, and online behavior. We clean and normalize the data, visualize trends, and apply clustering algorithms like K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN, evaluating results with metrics like the silhouette score and visualizing insights with charts and dashboards.

Using tools like Python, R, and various libraries, we generate detailed customer profiles and actionable marketing insights. Future work may involve real-time segmentation, predictive modeling, and CRM integration for automated marketing.
